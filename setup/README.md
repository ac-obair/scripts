This is an on going work in progress, I've been setting up my mac and as I do just adding things in here until I consider it complete

#### setup

**Note** I'm using zsh-completions and not bash-completions I will be keeping the `.zshrc` file in this repo uptodate. 

`git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-completions`

Enable it in your .zshrc by adding it to your plugin list and reloading the completion:

```
plugins=(â€¦ zsh-completions)
autoload -U compinit && compinit
```
